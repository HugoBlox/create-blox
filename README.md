# [Create Hugo Blox](https://github.com/HugoBlox/create-blox)

**Looking to build and publish a new [Hugo Blox](https://hugoblox.com/blocks/)?**

_[**Hugo Blox**](https://hugoblox.com) makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free, customizing your site without code by using drag-and-drop blocks (aka blox) rendered with Hugo._

## üëâ Core Concepts

- Each blox consists of an HTML file and an optional CSS style file
- Design your blox with [Go Templating](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Unless you are already familiar with Tailwind, it's recommended to use vanilla CSS as Tailwind styles require an extra [compilation step](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/extend/#recompile-tailwind) prior to use

## üßë‚Äçüé® Create a Block

1. Click the [_Use This Template_](https://github.com/HugoBlox/create-blox/generate) button on GitHub
   1. Name your repository with an appropriate name for your blox collection, such as `johns-hugo-blox`
1. Browse your new GitHub project, click the  `go.mod` file, and then the ‚úèÔ∏è pencil button to edit it
   1. Replace the placeholder URL in `go.mod` with your new GitHub URL in the form `module github.com/<USERNAME>/<COLLECTION-NAME>` where `<USERNAME>` is your GitHub username and `<COLLECTION-NAME>` is a name for your collection of blox
   1. Scroll to the bottom and click _Commit Changes_ to save
1. Browse to the `blox/` folder, click `my-block.html`, and click the ‚úèÔ∏è pencil button to edit it
   1. Rename `my-block.html` in the text box to a unique ID in the form `github.<USERNAME>.<BLOCK-NAME>.html`, again replacing  `<USERNAME>` with your GitHub username and `<BLOCK-NAME>` with your block name. It's important to provide this **globally unique block name**, otherwise another block can conflict with your block.
   1. Repeat the above step to rename the style file, `my-block.css`
   1. Scroll to the bottom and click _Commit Changes_ to save
1. Edit the HTML for your new block
   - Design your blox with [Go Templating](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/), [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
   - You can access page and block (page section) variables using `$page` and `$block`, respectively
   - Check out the [built-in blocks](https://github.com/HugoBlox/hugo-blox-builder/tree/main/modules/blox-tailwind/layouts/partials/blox) for inspiration

### Example

Say your GitHub username is `pikachu` and you wish to create a block named `pokemon`:

1. We click _Use This Template_ and enter `pokemon-hugo-blox` as the project name
1. We replace the first line of `go.mod` with the GitHub repository URL `module github.com/pikachu/hugo-blox-pokemon`
1. We browse to the `blox/` folder, and rename `my-block.html` to `github.pikachu.pokemon.html`
1. We rename `my-block.css` to `github.pikachu.pokemon.css`
1. We customize the HTML in `github.pikachu.pokemon.html` and the style in `github.pikachu.pokemon.css`
1. We add the block to our site and share the block with the community following the guide below

## üåà Add the Block to your Site

1. Install the block by referencing it in your `config/_defaults/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   module:
     imports:
       # Your block's GitHub URL (replace <USERNAME> and <COLLECTION-NAME> with your GitHub username and block collection name)
       - path: github.com/<USERNAME>/hugo-blox-<COLLECTION-NAME>
   ```
1. Create an instance of your block in a landing page, such as in your homepage at `content/_index.md`:
   ```markdown
   ---
   title: My page
   type: landing

   # Add your page sections below
   # Replace <USERNAME> and <BLOCK-NAME> with your GitHub username and block name, respectively.
   sections:
     - block: 'github.<USERNAME>.<BLOCK-NAME>'
       content:
         title: My title
         text: Add any **markdown** formatted content here - text, images, videos, galleries - and even HTML code!
    ---
   ```

## üì¢ Share your block

Add the [hugo-blox](https://github.com/topics/hugo-blox) tag to your block's GitHub repository to help other users find it.

Share your block with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%27m%20creating%20a%20beautiful%20website%20using%20the%20free%20%E2%9D%A4%EF%B8%8F%2C%20open%20source%20Hugo%20Blox%20Website%20Builder%20for%20%40GoHugoIO%20by%20%40GeorgeCushen%20%40GetResearchDev%20%E2%9C%A8%20Have%20some%20feedback%3F%20Please%20comment%20%F0%9F%A4%97&hashtags=MadeWithHugoBlox&url=https://HugoBlox.com/).
